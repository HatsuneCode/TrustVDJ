## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Add more details about the package methods in my Description text.
* write TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F.
* Lengthy examples (> 5 sec) are wrapped in \donttest.

# TrustVDJ v0.1.0

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 20.04 install, R 4.1.2
* win-builder (release, devel)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs

If --run-donttest, there will be a NOTE: 
* non-standard things in the check directory 'IMGT_download.fa' 'IMGT_reference' 'vdj_species.html'.
It is normal.

## Downstream dependencies

There is no package that depends on TrustVDJ.
