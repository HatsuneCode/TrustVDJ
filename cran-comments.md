## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Add more details about the package functionality and implemented methods in my Description text.
* write TRUE and FALSE instead of T and F.
* Lengthy examples (> 5 sec) are wrapped in \donttest.


# TrustVDJ v0.1.0

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 20.04 install, R 4.1.2
* win-builder (release, devel)
